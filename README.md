# A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...

Hello there! My name is Krystal Lopez, I am a software engineering associate participating in the RISE Apprenticeship Program provided by Multiverse and Cisco Systems. What you see here is my very first class project. The project that you see here is my own personal website, while it is a work in progress it demonstrates the core skills that were taught to me for the first 4 weeks of my apprenticeship. 

I have utilized only <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> to create this website and have used various techniques to create my web page. I used flexbox to create the boxed images that you can on the About Me page as well as the Portfolio page. I also used various CSS stlyings to get the background colors. At the home page you can see some of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite movies, Star Wars. If you can't tell, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan! 

I hope that in visiting my website you can see how everything comes together, feel free to browse through my code. But most of all, enjoy!
