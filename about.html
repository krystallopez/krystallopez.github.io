     <p id="aboutme">
      My name is Krystal Lopez and I was born and raised in the Windy City, Chicago! I now   reside in the golden state of California. I live in southern California, specifically in Ventura, CA. I have a beautiful family, that consists of myself, my partner, our daughter, and our cat Diana. My culture and heritage are very important to me. My family comes from Puerto Rico and I hope to one day regain my fluency in Spanish.

      As you may have guessed it, I am a huge nerd! While my love of all things Stars is infinite, I share interests in plenty of other fandoms as well. I started collecting comics when I was younger. I remember my first comic was an Archie comics that my grandma bought me from the grocery store and since then I've been hooked!

    Another one of my many interests is gaming! I <b>LOVE</b> video games! There is nothing better after a long week of work and hopping on to your console or PC and gaming with your friends. One of the games that I play the most is Destiny 2. (That's me in that photo on the left there!) I also enjoy reading, it is one of my favorite things to do. Any chance I get some time to myself I always try popping open one of my favorite books.
